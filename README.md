# MissileCommander

This was very old project (15 years+), which was fun at the time. 
However, the game concept was not very creative and there is zero story. 

I made a maven project out of it and refactored it so it has more clean code.
It doesn't depend on anything, except I guess now a bit of Java 8.

When I find the time I'll make it a bit nicer and finally port it to Android or so ;)
